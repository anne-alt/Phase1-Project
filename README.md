# Phase1-Project

# Project Goals
- Create an app with a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

- The entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects.

- The app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

- Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

- Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.


# Description
 
 I am creating a web application that gives a tips on how to prepare a few cocktails. The application allows for users to also log their preferred mixes onto the app as well as like the choices provided. 

 # Instructions

 # create HTML and JavaScript file

 # fetch data
 - When the page loads, make a fetch request to the REST API to get all the drinks. With the response, create an element,'div', for each drink and add to the div container that stores all the drinks information.

 # elements for fetched data
 - For every 'div' element created, create child elements to store the drinks data;

 'img' with the 'src' tag to hold the drinks imageUrl
 'div' with the class name 'cute', to hold drink's name.
 'div' with the class name 'cuter' to hold drink's ingredients.
 'div' with the class name 'cutest' to hold drink's instructions and a like-glyph.

 
# creat forms

- to my html file, add form that allows the user to log their own ingredients and/or instructions to the application.

# create dropdown

- to my html file, create selection option that alows users to pick how they'd like their drinks besides the options provided.
